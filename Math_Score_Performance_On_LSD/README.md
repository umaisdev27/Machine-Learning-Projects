**Description:**  
This chart illustrates how LSD is distributed across various tissues in the human body. It highlights how quickly LSD reaches the brain and how long it remains active in different organs.  
📌 *Fun fact:* LSD doesn’t just mess with your mind; it goes on a full-on body vacation.

**Description:**  
This image compares logical arithmetic thinking with the altered state induced by LSD-25. It’s basically what happens when your brain switches from calculator mode to cosmic mode.  
🔍 *Conclusion:* After LSD, not only do numbers bend, but reality also applies for sick leave.
