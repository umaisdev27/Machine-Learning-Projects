# Predicting House Prices in Boston

This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using statistical analysis, correlation studies, and regression modeling.

## 1. Data Correlation Analysis

We first examine the correlation between all features in the dataset to identify key relationships.

## 2. Feature Relationship Exploration

We visualize how specific features relate to each other and to house prices.

* **DIS vs NOX** – Relationship between distance to employment centers and nitric oxide concentration:

## 3. Data Transformation & Model Training

We apply transformations to the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and prepare it for model building.

**Log Transformation vs Actual Values:**
